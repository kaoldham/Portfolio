    "- *Observed Trend 1*: Based on overall passing rates, all of the top five schools are charter schools, and all of the bottom five schools are district schools. Charter schools also outperform district schools in average math score, average reading score, percent passing math, and percent passing reading.\n",
    "- *Observed Trend 2*: Which school a student attended appeared to have more of an impact on average math and reading scores than grade level. School size also appeared to influence average math and reading scores, as well as percent passing math and reading and overall passing rate, with students at small schools (less than 1,700 total students) faring better than those at medium or large schools.\n",
    "- *Observed  Trend 3*: Per student budget was not a strong indicator of student performance (as measured by average math and reading scores, percent passing math and reading, and overall passing rate). Students at schools with per student budgets less than \\$615 per student scored higher in each of these categories than those at schools with per student budgets above \\$615 dollars per student.\n",

    "**Conclusion**: School size and type appeared to be the best indicators for student performance based on these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Questions**: How do charter schools compare in size to district schools? It is possible that students at charter schools perform better because those schools are smaller than district schools, but more analysis is needed before we can determine whether that is true."
